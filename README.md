# OBR-pratica
This repository contains all the PyBrick code I used and tested for competing in the Brazilian Robotics Olympiad (OBR). I achieved victory in the 2022 OBR regional competition in Rond√¥nia, advancing to the national stage. In 2023, although I competed again, my focus had shifted towards web development, and unfortunately, I did not secure another victory.
